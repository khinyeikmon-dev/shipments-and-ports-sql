## 🗄️ Data Setup

The dataset is provided as CSV files and loaded into a SQL database.

Steps:
1. Create tables using `schema.sql`
2. Load data from CSV files
3. Run analytical queries from `queries.sql`

This mirrors a real-world analytics workflow where raw data is ingested, structured, and queried.
